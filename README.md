This repository demonstrates a common TypeError in Python that arises when performing operations on variables of incompatible types.  The bug.py file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.py presents a solution to handle this error. The bug is caused by the lack of explicit type handling within the function, leading to an unexpected failure when trying to add an integer to a string.
